        <h2>Understanding Homelessness</h2>
        <p>Homelessness can happen to anyone and is much more than just not having a roof over your head. It’s defined as living in inadequate housing, such as sleeping rough, staying in temporary or overcrowded shelters, or couch surfing (Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2021). Many factors can lead to homelessness, such as domestic abuse, financial instability, and mental health issues (Phipps et al., 2019). It also stems from broader societal issues like the lack of affordable housing and low welfare support (Brown & Mueller, 2014; Perez, 2014).</p>

        <h2>How Does Homelessness Impact Health?</h2>
        <p>People who are homeless face serious health challenges. They suffer from higher rates of infectious diseases, 
            poor oral health, mental illness, and chronic conditions than the general population (Aldridge et al., 2018;
             Davies & Wood, 2018; Queen et al., 2017; Vallesi et al., 2021). Unfortunately, they also face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, including long waiting times, difficulty registering with general practitioners, and lack of transportation (Dorney‐Smith et al., 2021). As a result, many homeless individuals end up relying on emergency departments for healthcare, which only adds pressure to hospitals (Lewer et al., 2021).</p>

        <h2>Homelessness and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</h2>
        <p>Homelessness is directly connected to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
             SDG 1 (No Poverty) highlights how poverty drives homelessness, while SDG 3 
             (Good Health and Well-Being) recognises the poor health outcomes faced by 
             homeless people due to inadequate access to healthcare (Aldridge et al., 2018).
              Additionally, SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) focuses on the social and economic
               exclusion that homeless people often experience, further emphasising the importance
                of addressing homelessness at a structural level (Brown & Mueller, 2014).</p>

        <h2>The Social Gradient of Health and Homelessness</h2> 
        <p>Wilkinson and Marmot’s (2003) Social Gradient of Health theory explains that people with lower socioeconomic
             status experience worse health outcomes. This is particularly true for people experiencing homelessness, who often
              find themselves at the bottom of this health gradient. Homeless individuals have shorter life expectancies and higher 
              mortality rates due to the significant barriers they face in accessing healthcare and social services (Baggett et al., 2013; Pearson et al., 2021).</p>

    <h2>Call to Action</h2>
    <p>Breaking the cycle of homelessness requires action on multiple levels. At a personal level, individuals need access to healthcare, support for mental health and addiction issues, and safe, affordable housing (Dorney‐Smith et al., 2021). At a societal level, there needs to be more affordable housing options, better welfare systems, and increased support for people exiting homelessness (Brown & Mueller, 2014). By learning about these issues, you can develop a deeper understanding and empathy for those affected by homelessness.
        You have the power to make a real difference! By taking small but meaningful actions, you can help change lives. Start by volunteering at local shelters, standing up for better housing options, and using your voice to spread the message that homelessness is a crisis we can’t ignore. Every step you take brings us closer to creating a world where everyone has a safe place to call home.
