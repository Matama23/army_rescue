                <h3>
                    Spiritual Support: </h3>   
                    <p>	Support groups create a community where individuals share their experiences. It opens an opportunity to share your own stories, these groups aim to create a safe space where members can interact with each other, establishing a sense of connection and shared experiences. These groups aim to bring comfort and clarity to the members as they share common experiences 
                        	Support groups can be scary for some but it is a great way to make new connections with people you share common stories with!
                        The support group will be held every Friday and 6PM at Melbourne CBD
                        Meals will be provided and there will be fun interactive games to play. 
                    </p> 
                <h3>Financial Help : </h3>
                <p>Food insecurity is defined as having insufficient access to adequate amounts of food that is healthy and nourishing. Various people of different socioeconomic backgrounds suffer from food insecurity, however, the population group that tends to suffer the most are the homeless Parpouchi et al. (2016).
                    To help those who are experiencing food insecurity, making simple food donations to large organisations such as food banks can go a long way and help those who 
                    are struggling financially.
